# GA_Queens_Puzzle
A Genetic Algorithm implementation in Java that solves the 8 Queens problem.

It is a quickly implemented proof of concept and below are the important details of this sample application:

- Runs with Java 7.
- It thinks of the chessboard as a 2D matrix with starting index 1. For example, the Position (1,1) would 
  be the first square in the board.
- It gives the results in terms of the positions found.
- It may not converges the first time but it does eventually, just run it twice or thrice if you don't get an immediate result.
- You can change the GA parameters in the ga-app-config.xml file.
- It is a simple proof of concept that implements basic selection, crossover and mutation methods.

Hope someone finds it useful!
